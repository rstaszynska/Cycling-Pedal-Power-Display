# Cycling Pedal Power Display



### Introduction: 
The following repository contains a desktop application developed using the Electron framework to act as part of a Cycling Pedal Power Exhibit which aims to raise awareness about the energy consumption, carbon dioxide equivalent emissions and cost of six common household appliances (LED light bulb, incandescent light bulb, kettle, toaster, laptop, and washing machine). Users of the application can engage in three types of energy-generating challenges available for all six appliances. A solo mode challenge allows users to engage in the energy-generating simulation individually, a competitive duo mode challenge allows two users to compete in a cycling race, and a cooperative duo mode challenge allows two users to attempt to reach a common energy-generating goal.

### Installation:
See the manual.md file for installation instructions.


### Usage:
The application can be paired with turbo trainers via Bluetooth to initiate the energy-generating cycling challenges. The fixed turbo trainer names assigned by Bluetooth must be replaced in the code to run the code on your own turbo trainers. Additionally, the styling of the application may have to be adjusted to fit screens of varying resolutions as it was adapted for a specific use case.
